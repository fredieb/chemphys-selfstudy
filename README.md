# Computational and Theoretical Chemistry & Physics Learning Journey

Welcome to my self-directed, full-time study project in **computational and theoretical chemistry and physics**.

## 🧭 Overview

This project follows a detailed monthly roadmap, designed to simulate the intensity and depth of a graduate-level course:

- 📐 **Month 1:** Linear Algebra, Calculus, Python, Git, LaTeX  
- 🌡️ **Month 2:** Classical Mechanics, Thermodynamics, Physical Chemistry  
- 🔬 **Month 3:** Quantum Mechanics, Hartree-Fock Theory  
- 🧮 **Month 4:** Density Functional Theory, Geometry Optimization  
- 💥 **Month 5:** Molecular Dynamics, Solid-State Physics  
- 🧠 **Month 6:** Post-HF Methods, Condensed Matter, Capstone Project  

## 🛠️ Tools & Languages

We will see...

## 📂 Repository Structure

- `notebooks/` – Jupyter notebooks for simulations and code experiments  
- `notes/` – LaTeX notes and summaries on theory and methods  
- `projects/` – Mini-projects, simulations, and capstone work  
- `references/` – Study sources, papers, and useful links  

## 📌 Goals

- Build a strong theoretical foundation
- Develop real-world simulation skills
- Reproduce or extend published research
- Publish code and notes for open access
